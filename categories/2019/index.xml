Linux kernel has different types of locks for synchronization. Spin locks, Semaphores, Futexes are some examples. These locks have different behavior and if they are not used properly, it can create performance degradation. For example, spinlocks have least locking and unlocking times but they waste CPU cycles. Spinlocks are used when the waiting time is known to be small. But if a kernel thread is waiting for a spinlock for a considerable amount of time, CPU time is wasted and system performance will be severely affected.</description></item><item><title>Build Useful Tools With Ebpf Part1 Setup Bcc</title><link>http://ebpf.xyz/post/build-useful-tools-with-ebpf-part1-setup-bcc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:23:13 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://ebpf.xyz/post/build-useful-tools-with-ebpf-part1-setup-bcc/</guid><description>Addr：https://ebpf.xyz/post/build-useful-tools-with-ebpf-part1-setup-bc</description></item><item><title>Klock Stat</title><link>http://ebpf.xyz/post/klock-stat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:13:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://ebpf.xyz/post/klock-stat/</guid><description>Addr：https://ebpf.xyz/post/klock-stat
kLockStat: An eBPF Tool To Monitor Linux Kernel Lock Contentions APRIL 30, 2019
Today most of the applications are multithreaded. Parallelism improves performance of applications. But there can be scalability bottlenecks inside the kernel. There are studies that exposes such bottlenecks in linux kernel. Even if the application is written in a perfectly scalable fasion, sometimes the bottlenecks inside the kernel prevent the application from scaling to a large number of processors.</description></item><item><title>Concurrency Management in BPF</title><link>http://ebpf.xyz/post/concurrency-management-in-bpf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 23:16:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://ebpf.xyz/post/concurrency-management-in-bpf/</guid><description>Addr：https://ebpf.xyz/post/concurrency-management-in-bpf
In the beginning, programs run on the in-kernel BPF virtual machine had no persistent internal state and no data that was shared with any other part of the system. The arrival of eBPF and, in particular, its maps functionality, has changed that situation, though, since a map can be shared between two or more BPF programs as well as with processes running in user space. That sharing naturally leads to concurrency problems, so the BPF developers have found themselves needing to add primitives to manage concurrency (the &amp;ldquo;exchange and add&amp;rdquo; or XADD instruction, for example).</description></item><item><title>Dive into BPF: a list of reading material</title><link>http://ebpf.xyz/post/dive_into_ebpf_read_list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 11:25:58 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://ebpf.xyz/post/dive_into_ebpf_read_list/</guid><description>Addr：https://ebpf.xyz/post/dive_into_ebpf_read_list

1. What is BPF? BPF, as in Berkeley Packet Filter, was initially conceived in 1992 so as to provide a way to filter packets and to avoid useless packet copies from kernel to userspace. It initially consisted in a simple bytecode that is injected from userspace into the kernel, where it is checked by a verifier—to prevent kernel crashes or security issues—and attached to a socket, then run on each received packet.</description></item><item><title>What is eBPF?</title><link>http://ebpf.xyz/post/what_is_ebpf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 23:34:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://ebpf.xyz/post/what_is_ebpf/</guid><description>Addr: https://awesome-ebpf.github.io//what_is_ebpf
1. What is eBPF? eBPF is a revolutionary technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in an operating system kernel. It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel without requiring to change kernel source code or load kernel modules.
Historically, the operating system has always been an ideal place to implement observability, security, and networking functionality due to the kernel’s privileged ability to oversee and control the entire system.</description></item></channel></rss>
